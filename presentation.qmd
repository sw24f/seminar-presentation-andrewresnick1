# Introduction

## About Galit Shmueli

- 46 y/o, Dr. Galit Shmueli is a Chair Professor at the National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan.
- Authored many influential works in predictive analytics, data mining, and business analytics.
- "To Explain or to Predict?" is Shmueli's most cited work, 3,679 times.

## Purpose of To Explain or to Predict

- Tackling the distinction between explanatory and predictive modelling in Statistics.
- Lack of this distinction creates multiple problems within different disciplines.
  - Gap between academia and practice
  - Finance, psychology, philosophy

# Background

## Explanatory Modeling
- Explaining: Causal explanation
- Explanatory modeling: Use of statistical models for testing causal explanations
- In practice: association-based models are applied to observational data
  - Most common: Regression model
  - Justification: Theory itself provides the causality 

## Predictive Modeling
- Predictive Modeling: the process of applying a statistical model or data mining algorithm to data for the purpose of predicting new or future observations.
- Shmueli focuses on "nonstochastic prediction" - the goal being to predict output value for new observations given their input values.

## Descriptive Modeling
- Descriptive Modeling: aimed at summarizing or representing the data structure in a compact manner
- Absent or less incorporated causal theory
- Regression:
  - Can be descriptive if used for capturing the association between dependent and independent variables
  - Not descriptive if purpose is causal inference or prediction

# Why they are different

## Cause
- Theory:
  - Suppose a theory that construct X causes construct Y via function F
  - Statistical model, f, defined as E(Y) = f(X)
- Explanatory modeling attempts to match f and F as closely as possible
- Predictive modeling attempts to utilize X, Y, and model f to generate good predictions of Y

## Effect - Causation Association
- Causation-Association:
  - Explanatory: Model f represents an underlying causal function, X is assumed to cause Y.
  - Predictive: Model f captures assocation between X and Y.
## Effect - Theory-Data
- Theory-Data:
  - Explanatory: Model f is constructed based on F in a way that supports the interpretation of the relationship between X, Y, and testing the causal hypotheses.
  - Predictive: Model f is constructed from the data. Interpretability of the relationship between X & Y are not required, sometimes desired for transparency.
## Effect - Retrospective-Prospective:
- Retrospective-Prospective:
  - Explanatory: Retrospective, model f is used to test an existing set of hypotheses.
  - Predictive: Prospective, model f is constructed for new observations.
## Effect - Bias-Variance:
  - Explanatory: Focus is on minimizing bias to obtain the most accurate representation of the theory.
  - Predictive: 
    - Focus is on minimizing bias and estimation variance. May occasionally sacrifice accuracy for empirical precision. 
    - "Wrong" model may predict better than the "correct" one.

# Statistical Modeling Differences

## Study Design and Data Collection
- Explanatory: 
  - Smaller n, just enough to reduce bias
  - Increase in number of groups in hierarchial data
  - Clean, experimental data
  - Valid, reliable data collection tool, accurately reflecting studied concepts
  - Factorial designs
- Prediction:
  - Larger n
  - Increase in size of group in hierarchial data
  - Observational data, avoiding "overly clean"
  - Measurement quality & meaning to the predicting variable

## Data Preparation
- Explanatory:
  - Partitioning is less common, i.e. test sets, because of the reduction in statistical power.
    - When used, can be useful for model validity.
- Predictive:
  - Data partitioning has become a standard preprocessing step.
  - Missing values:
    - Depends on the relationship between the missingness and dependent variable.
      - In cases of financial fraud, missingness can be a blessing in disguise.
    - Estimate multiple reduced models, creating different models for different observations.
    
## Exploratory Data Analysis
- Explanatory:
  - EDA is geared toward specified causal relationships.
  - Search for numerical summaries of the theoretical relationships.
- Predictive:
  - Capturing potentially unknown relationships.
  - Explore a large number of numerical summaries seeking unknown relationships.
  - Reduction in the number of variables reduces sampling variance.

## Choice of Variables
- Explanatory:
  - Goal is to understand causal relationships by using variables represented in the theoretical constructs
  - Variables may be chosen based on the role of the variables based on different fields.
  - Hard to avoid bias, solutions include 2SLS.
  - May only include "control" variables that take place before the causal variable
  - Must include main effects if interaction terms of those effects
- Predictive:
  - Predictors must be available at time of prediction
  - Quality of association, data quality, 

## Choice of Methods
- Explanatory:
  - Requires interpretable statistical models, f, therefore regression is popular.
  - Not suited for algorithmic models such as KNN or neural networks.
- Predictive:
  - f is often unknown, so can include statistical models and data mining algorithms. 
  - Algorithmic models are very suitable for predictive and descriptive modeling.
  - Shrinkage & Ensemble methods from Bias-Variance.

## Validation, Evaluation, Selection
- Explanatory:
  - Model validation & model fit
  - Explanatory power, strength of relationship.
  - Selected from highest explanatory power.
- Predictive:
  - Generalization, ability of fitted model to predict new data.
  - Predictive power, performance of fitted model on new data.
  - Variety of methods for predictive accuracy, AIC, BIC.

## Model Use and Reporting
- Explanatory:
  - Used to create statistical conclusions, testing causal hypotheses.
  - In practical use, dominated by statistical inference.
- Predictive:
  - Practically used for scientific predictive studies.
  - Emphasize data, association, bias-variance, prospects of the study.

# Real Examples

## Netflix Prize - Predictive Approach
- Large sample size, ensemble of methods, setting the stage for explanatory research.
- Explanatory context leads to completely different modeling path.
- Winning team combined skills within computer science and statistics.

## eBay Auction Research - Explanatory Approach
- Previous explanatory research based in game theory, used to test robustness of hypothesized effects across different variables.
- Omit number of bidders due to endogeneity, adding bias to the model.
- Predictive models use flexible, algorithmic models with low interpretability but high predictive accuracy.
- Cannot provide causal explanations, but shed light on new variables related to price. 

## Revealjs Options

- `slide-number`: display the slide number on each slide
- `preview-links`: open links in an overlay on the slide
- `theme`: configure the presentation theme
- `incremental`: items in lists appear individually
- `footer`: include a footer at the bottom of each slide

Many other options can be used under `revealjs` to customize a presentation.

## YAML Example

``` yaml
---
title: "Creating Presentations with Quarto"
subtitle: "Introduction to Data Science | Fall 2024"
format:
    revealjs:
        slide-number: true
        preview-links: true
        theme: default
---
```

This is a verbatim copy of the YAML code used in the Quarto file for this presentation!

## Subsequent Slides

- To create a section slide, use a single `#` followed by the slide's title.
- To create a regular slide, use a double `##` followed by the slide's title. Then, use markdown syntax to add content to the slide after the title line.

The title slide **does not** need to be added in this way; it is created and included automatically based on the information in the YAML code block!

## Slides Example

``` markdown
---
title: "Example Presentation"
date: today
author: "NAME"
format: revealjs
---

# Section Title

## List A

- Bullet Point 1A
- Bullet Point 2A

## List B

- Bullet Point 1B
- Bullet Point 2B
```

# Slide Content

## Code Blocks

- It may be useful to display blocks of code in a slide.
- Open a code block with at least three ```` ``` ```` followed by the language of the code.
- Close a code block with the same number of ```` ``` ```` as in the opening.

## Code Block Example

For example, the following code *in the Quarto document*

```` markdown
``` python
import numpy as np
np.arange(10)
```
````

will yield the following output *in the rendered slide*.

``` python
import numpy as np
np.arange(10)
```

Notice that this does not run the Python code; it simply displays the block of code in the slide.

## Executable Code

To display the output of a code block in a slide, enclose the programming language inside `{}`. For example, the following code *in the Quarto document*

```` python
```{{python}}
import numpy as np
np.arange(10)
```
````

will yield the following output *in the rendered slide*.

```{python}
import numpy as np
np.arange(10)
```

Including a period inside `{}` before the programming language will display the code block instead of running it.

## Images from Code Output

Executable code blocks can be used to display images in slides. Consider the following code example.

```` python
```{{python}}
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-cap: "A line plot on a polar axis"

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

r = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)
theta = 2 * np.pi * r
fig, ax = plt.subplots(
  subplot_kw = {'projection': 'polar'} 
)
ax.plot(theta, r)
ax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])
ax.grid(True)
plt.show()
```
````

## Images from Code Output -- Example

The preceding code example will create the following image.

```{python}
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-cap: "A line plot on a polar axis"

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

r = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)
theta = 2 * np.pi * r
fig, ax = plt.subplots(
  subplot_kw = {'projection': 'polar'} 
)
ax.plot(theta, r)
ax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])
ax.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

## Images from Files

It is also possible to insert an image from a saved file.

```{python}
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-cap: "A line plot on a polar axis"

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

r = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)
theta = 2 * np.pi * r
fig, ax = plt.subplots(
  subplot_kw = {'projection': 'polar'} 
)
ax.plot(theta, r)
ax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])
ax.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

## Images from Files -- Markdown Syntax

To import a saved image for display in a slide, use the following markdown syntax as an example. This line of code may be used to display the image on the previous slide.

``` markdown
![A line plot on a polar axis](polar_axis.png)
```

- The caption for the figure is enclosed inside `[]`.
- The file path for the saved image file is enclosed inside `()`.

Remember to use relative references, as opposed to absolute references, when specifying the file path!

## Markdown Syntax for Links

To create a link, use the same markdown syntax as before, but omit the initial `!`.

- The text of the link is enclosed inside `[]`.
- The URL is enclosed inside `()`.

For example, use the following markdown syntax to obtain a link to the Quarto website.

``` markdown
[Quarto](https://quarto.org)
```

[Quarto](https://quarto.org)

## Tables -- Markdown Syntax

Refer to the [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/tables.html) for a comprehensive explanation on the details of creating tables in markdown.

The basic syntax for a simple table is illustrated by the following example.

``` markdown
| Left | Center | Right |
|:-----|:------:|------:|
| ABC  | ABC    | ABC   |
| ABCD | ABCD   | ABCD  |
```

| Left | Center | Right |
|:-----|:------:|------:|
| ABC  | ABC    | ABC   |
| ABCD | ABCD   | ABCD  |

## Mathematical Notation

- Use LaTeX to typeset mathematical notation.
- In-text math is enclosed with a single `$` on each side.
- Display math is enclosed with a double `$$` on each side.

## LaTeX Example

``` markdown
$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$
The quadratic formula is given by the above equation.
This is used to find the solutions to the equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.
```

$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$
The quadratic formula is given by the above equation.
This is used to find the solutions to the equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.

# Slide Customization

## Incremental Lists

::: {.incremental}
- This slide contains an incremental list.
- Lists on specific slides can be configured to display incrementally.
- Alternatively, lists can display incrementally by default for the entire presentation.
- Additionally, incremental displays can be disabled on specific slides, when lists display incrementally by default.
:::

## Incremental Lists -- Entire Presentation

By including the following under the `revealjs` options in the YAML block, bulleted and numbered lists will display incrementally by default.

``` yaml
---
title: "Presentation Title"
format:
    revealjs:
        incremental: true
---
```

## Incremental Lists -- Specific Slides

By enclosing a list's code in a div, the display of the list can go against the default setting.

To make a list incremental:

``` markdown
::: {.incremental}
- Item 1
- Item 2
:::
```

To make a list non-incremental:

``` markdown
::: {.nonincremental}
- Item 1
- Item 2
:::
```

## Div Containers

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- The previous slide demonstrated how div containers may be used to override default settings.
- The next slide will demonstrate how they may be used to display content in multiple columns, as in the current slide.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Divs are useful for adding various attributes to specific pieces of code.
- Furthermore, divs may be nested within each other.
- For more information on the syntax and application of div containers, refer to the [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html#sec-divs-and-spans).
:::

::::

## Multiple Columns

This framework, which makes use of nested divs, enables the display of multiple columns in a slide.

``` markdown
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
Left Column
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Right Column
:::

::::
```

## Avoiding Content Overflow: Introducing a Scroll Bar {.scrollable}

- Be mindful of the amount of content on each slide.
- Render the presentation frequently to see if content overflow is present on any slides.
- If a slide overflows with content, consider separating it into more than one slide.
- If separating the content is not possible, it may be useful to introduce a scroll bar into the slide.

This can be accomplished by including `{.scrollable}` after the slide title, as shown in the following example.

``` markdown
## Avoiding Content Overflow: Introducing a Scroll Bar {.scrollable}
```

If content overflow is a problem throughout the presentation, the scroll bar can be applied to all slides by including `scrollable: true` under `revealjs` in the YAML block.

## Avoiding Content Overflow: Decreasing the Text Size {.smaller}

- Be mindful of the amount of content on each slide.
- Render the presentation frequently to see if content overflow is present on any slides.
- If a slide overflows with content, consider separating it into more than one slide.
- If separating the content is not possible, it may be useful to decrease the size of the text on the slide.

This can be accomplished by including `{.smaller}` after the slide title, as shown in the following example.

``` markdown
## Avoiding Content Overflow: Decreasing the Text Size {.smaller}
```

If content overflow is a problem throughout the presentation, the smaller text size can be applied to all slides by including `smaller: true` under `revealjs` in the YAML block.

# Conclusion

## Summary

This presentation has covered:

- Creating slides in a Revealjs presentation
